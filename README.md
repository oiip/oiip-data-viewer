## Welcome to the OIIP Data Viewer

This web application was developed as part of the Oceanographic In-Situ data Interoperability Project (OIIP) at NASA/JPL in collaboration with UCAR/Unidata, the Large Pelagics Research Center, and University of Massachusetts, Boston. The primary goal of the application is progress the architecture and design of applications that pair in-situ and remote sensing data products. To that end, it visualizes a select number of oceanographic remote sensing datasets (such as sea surface temperature and ocean current speed) as well as vertically resolved animal tag and ship based sensor tracks.

For more information on the project, please visit: [https://oiip.jpl.nasa.gov/](https://oiip.jpl.nasa.gov/)
For a demonstration of the tool, please see: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgOTwWWMhdc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgOTwWWMhdc)

This application is built off of the [Common Mapping Client](https://github.com/nasa/common-mapping-client)
